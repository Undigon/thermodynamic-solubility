# thermodynamic-solubility
A software implementation of a couple of my easily iterable solubility equations.

###### My first equation
It's very specific. It's to be used for 1+1 cation-anion solutions and 1+1 cation-anion solute, for quick calculator usage requiring just the ans function.
Using a fuller expression of the... median activity was it called? might be more useful.

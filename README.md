# thermodynamic-solubility
A software implementation of a couple of my easily iterable solubility equations.

###### My first equation
It's very specific. It's to be used for 1+1 cation-anion solutions and 1+1 cation-anion solute without the common ion effect. I made it for quick calculator usage requiring just the ans function.
Using a fuller expression of the... median activity method was it called? might be more useful.

Where:
* *C* stands for solution concentration in Molarity
* *Kps* stands for thermodynamic solubility constant, not solubility constant (e.g: Kps = activity1 \* activity2 = α1[c1] * α2*[c2])
